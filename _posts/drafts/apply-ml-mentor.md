## Manikandan Sivanesan - Principal Software Engineer @ Red Hat

### Please share a bit about yourself: your current role, where you work, and what you do?

- Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat Inforamtion Retrieval team
- Dual role as an IC and Management (functional) for a bit
- Building data powered products that
  - automates the support workflow for "Helping the Customer to faster first response"
  - augmenting the search experience for "Detecting the intent of Customer & driving them to the right experience"
- Outside work I engage in fastai community by participating & contributing in forums, chat etc

### What was your path towards working with Machine Learning? What factors helped along the way?

- Though I cursorily learned Machine Learning through courses such as 1) [Machine Learning - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) and 2) Udacity deep learning nano degree, I was never able to complete both specializations completely. I was cursed with my habit of not sticking with it long enough and not getting the chance to apply them practically at work. This made me realize that I may not be suitable for ML.

- At the start of 2019, I was introduced to fastai and the top-down learning approach. This completely change the way I learn better. [Learning Strategy for Top Down Approach](https://forums.fast.ai/t/learning-strategy-for-top-down-approach). In addition to that, I started actively participated in fastai study group by taking notes and also at times leading the group. This allows me to stick with it long enough and allowed me to compelte the courpse. In 2020, I was one of fastai International Fellow.

- Following the People instead of Trends. I stopped following trends but instead making use of People such as Jeremy Howard, Nirant, Eugene, Zach, Sanyam, Radek. They are my informal mentors. In my own definition mentors are someone who are ahead of the journey that you want to undertake and learning from the lessons/mistakes.  

- Identify projects and actively convincing the management about the user benefits by building proof of concepts either collaborating with data sciencetists and going solo. They are extension of the courses that I did outside work. For example after completing International Fellow, I applied ULMFiT at work for support routing automation and deployed it in Production.  

- Top Down Approach, Finding your tribe and Actively Participating & Contributing back.

### How do you spend your time day-to-day?

I normally use OKR for quarterly goal settings, monthly aspirations, weekly priorities (atleast 3), daily highlights.

For example

- Quarterly: Deploy ULMFiT that can reduce the misrouting from 15% to 10% error rate
- Monthly: Incorporate CD pipeline that can help to ship faster, Complete hugging-face fastai course and write down the learnings
- Weekly: Learn great expectations for pretesting
- Daily Highlight: Investigate the misrouting, Brainstorming for ML Sessions

### How do you work with business to identify and define problems suited for machine learning? How do you align ML projects with business objectives?

- Business problems in two lenses
  - 1. **Automation** - Should eliminate or automate mundane tasks performed by the user.
  - 2. **Augmentation** - Should enhance user experience in a product.
- Spend more time in Problem Framing Phase to map the business problems with an ML problem statement (Feasibility). Ask a series of questions
  - 1) Does this really require ML? Can we generate value much quicker without ML?
  - 2) Do we have enough useful data and access to data?
  - 3) What needle/metrics will it move for the business/customers if we accomplish it?
    - Does it generate revenue or save cost for the business? Does it save time or reduce effort for the users?
  - 4) Assuming we solved it successfully and once we have a prediction from the service, what does the user/business need to do with the predictions?
  - Failing to answer these questions early in project phase will lead to miscommunication and lack of support from the business.
- After prototype, create a POC/Demo for the stakeholders before diving into full fledged productionization phase.

- [DriveTrain Appaoch, a four step process for building data products](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/drivetrain-approach-data-products/) and [PAIR Guides](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/) shaped up my thinking process.
- Working as Product Owner for a couple of years helped me to always start with a) WHY are we solving a given b) WHAT we are solving for? c) WHEN do know we have if we have really solved the problem?. These 3Ws are essential before diving into the HOW part ie the implementation.

### Machine learning systems can be several steps removed from users, relative to product and UI. How do you maintain empathy with your end-users?

### Imagine you're given a new, unfamiliar problem to solve with machine learning. How would you approach it?

### Designing, building, and operating ML systems is a big effort. Who do you collaborate with? How do you scale yourself?

### There are many ways to structure DS/ML teams—what have you seen work, or not work?

### How does your organization or team enable rapid iteration on machine learning experiments and systems?

### What processes, tools, or artifacts have you found helpful in the machine learning lifecycle? What would you introduce if you joined a new team?

### How do you quantify the impact of your work? What was the greatest impact you made?

### After shipping your ML project, how do you monitor performance in production? Did you have to update pipelines or retrain models—how manual or automatic was this?

### Think of people who are able to apply ML effectively–what skills or traits do you think contributed to that?

### Do you have any lessons or advice about applying ML that's especially helpful? Anything that you didn't learn at school or via a book (i.e., only at work)?

### How do you learn continuously? What are some resources or role models that you've learned from?

- Follow people for the areas that you care about and interested to learn instead of trends. Leverage these experts as a noise filter.
