[Deep Search Query Intent Understanding](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2008.06759/) from LinkedIn provides two designs for modeling 1. Predicting the intent in typeahead search using character models 2. Predicting the intent for complete search queries to do Seach Results Page(SERP) Blending. Each linkedin usecase has its own latency and accuracy requirement, former having higher latency but with __lower accuracy__ whereas the latter with acceptable latency but with __higher accuracy__.

The recommendation is to perform manual annotation with __binary label__ in order to keep cognitive load low. This allows the annotator to focus only one concept at a time.

In this case, Prodigy will present the question as a binary task using the  classification interface. You can then hit ACCEPT or REJECT. Even if you have more than one label, it can sometimes be very efficient to make several passes over the data instead of selecting from a list of options. The annotators can focus on one concept at a time, which can reduce the potential for human error – especially when working with complicated texts and label schemes.\n",
