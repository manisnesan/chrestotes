### Hi there 👋

Welcome! I'm **Manikandan Sivanesan**, and this is my learning blog where I document my journey exploring search systems and agentic AI.

This blog serves as a medium to teach my past self and document discoveries for my future self about things I'm curious about. I write about information retrieval, search systems (particularly Apache Solr), NLP, and machine learning topics.

  *[HASOC 2020 conference](https://hasocfire.github.io/hasoc/2020/)*

  **Abstract:** This article describes our team Chrestotes' approach to the solution submitted to HASOC 2020: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages. We demonstrate an end to end solution to the fine-grained detection of hate speech in tweets. Our solution is focused on the English Task which has been split into two subtasks. Our model achieved macro-average f1-scores of 0.4969 and 0.2652 on the subtasks A and B respectively. This solution places us in the middle of the leaderboard for subtask A and first place for subtask B.
