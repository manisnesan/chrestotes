I am Manikandan Sivanesan, currently working as a Principal Software Engineer @ Red Hat on Search Relevance, Language Understanding and Ranking. Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning as a fast.ai international fellow.

This blog is a medium to teach the past version of myself and serve as a documentation to my future self about things that I'm curious about at a given point in time.
