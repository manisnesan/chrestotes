            "title": "fastcore: An Underrated Python Library",
            "content": ". Background . I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills: I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques. I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn&#39;t seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it. I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find! That&#39;s when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests? I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions. . And that&#39;s exactly what I did over the past month! I&#39;m pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ve discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also why the code works the way it does, and to explore edge cases while writing tests. Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible! It turns out the library I choose, fastcore is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique. . For the uninitiated, fastcore is a library on top of which many fast.ai projects are built on. Most importantly, fastcore extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I&#39;m going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python. My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more! . Why fastcore is interesting . Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python: I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer. From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work. Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell. Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages. | You get a new set of pragmatic tools: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems. | Learn more about the Python programming language: Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process. For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work. | A whirlwind tour through fastcore . Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention. . . Making **kwargs transparent . Whenever I see a function that has the argument **kwargs, I cringe a little. This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example: . def baz(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): return a + b + c def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, **kwargs)&gt; . Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that foo also accepts and additional parameters b and d. We can fix this with delegates: . def baz(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): return a + b + c @delegates(baz) # this decorator will pass down keyword arguments from baz def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4)&gt; . You can customize the behavior of this decorator. For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping **kwargs: . @delegates(baz, keep=True) def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4, **kwargs)&gt; . You can also exclude arguments. For example, we exclude argument d from delegation: . def basefoo(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): pass @delegates(basefoo, but= [&#39;d&#39;]) # exclude `d` def foo(c, a, **kwargs): pass inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2)&gt; . You can also delegate between classes: . class BaseFoo: def __init__(self, e, c=2): pass @delegates()# since no argument was passsed here we delegate to the superclass class Foo(BaseFoo): def __init__(self, a, b=1, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) inspect.signature(Foo) . &lt;Signature (a, b=1, c=2)&gt; . For more information, read the docs on delegates. . . Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes . Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in __init__? . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b ,c): self.a, self.b, self.c = a, b, c . Ouch! That was painful. Look at all the repeated variable names. Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class? Not Anymore! Checkout store_attr: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr() t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 . You can also exclude certain attributes: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr(but=[&#39;c&#39;]) t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 assert not hasattr(t, &#39;c&#39;) . There are many more ways of customizing and using store_attr than I highlighted here. Check out the docs for more detail. . . Avoiding subclassing boilerplate . One thing I hate about python is the __super__().__init__() boilerplate associated with subclassing. For example: . class ParentClass: def __init__(self): self.some_attr = &#39;hello&#39; class ChildClass(ParentClass): def __init__(self): super().__init__() cc = ChildClass() assert cc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; # only accessible b/c you used super . We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass PrePostInitMeta. We define a new class called NewParent that is a wrapper around the ParentClass: . class NewParent(ParentClass, metaclass=PrePostInitMeta): def __pre_init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super().__init__() class ChildClass(NewParent): def __init__(self):pass sc = ChildClass() assert sc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; . . Type Dispatch . Type dispatch, or Multiple dispatch, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives. This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia. For example, this is a conceptual example of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y: . collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting spaceship collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting spaceship . Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks. . Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box. Fortunately, there is the @typedispatch decorator to the rescue. This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function: . @typedispatch def f(x:str, y:str): return f&#39;{x}{y}&#39; @typedispatch def f(x:np.ndarray): return x.sum() @typedispatch def f(x:int, y:int): return x+y . Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function f: . f(&#39;Hello &#39;, &#39;World!&#39;) . &#39;Hello World!&#39; . f(2,3) . 5 . f(np.array([5,5,5,5])) . 20 . There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that you can read about here. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called multipledispatch made by Mathhew Rocklin (the creator of Dask). . After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing. . . A better version of functools.partial . functools.partial is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= val: . test_input = [1,2,3,4,5,6] def f(arr, val): &quot;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&quot; return [x for x in arr if x &gt;= val] f(test_input, 3) . [3, 4, 5, 6] . You can create a new function out of this function using partial that sets the default value to 5: . filter5 = partial(f, val=5) filter5(test_input) . [5, 6] . One problem with partial is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring: . filter5.__doc__ . &#39;partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application n of the given arguments and keywords. n&#39; . fastcore.utils.partialler fixes this, and makes sure the docstring is retained such that the new API is transparent: . filter5 = partialler(f, val=5) filter5.__doc__ . &#39;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&#39; . . Composition of functions . A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result. This is especially useful when applying various data transformations. Consider a toy example where I have three functions: (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers: . def add(arr, val): return [x + val for x in arr] def arrsum(arr): return sum(arr) # See the previous section on partialler add2 = partialler(add, val=2) transform = compose(filter5, add2, arrsum) transform([1,2,3,4,5,6]) . 15 . But why is this useful? You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with: . arrsum(add2(filter5([1,2,3,4,5,6]))) . You are not wrong! However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following: . def fit(x, transforms:list): &quot;fit a model after performing transformations&quot; x = compose(*transforms)(x) y = [np.mean(x)] * len(x) # its a dumb model. Don&#39;t judge me return y # filters out elements &lt; 5, adds 2, then predicts the mean fit(x=[1,2,3,4,5,6], transforms=[filter5, add2]) . [7.5, 7.5] . For more information about compose, read the docs. . . A more useful __repr__ . In python, __repr__ helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging. Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using store_attr, which was discussed earlier). . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() # `store_attr` was discussed previously Test(1) . &lt;__main__.Test at 0x7fe0ab662790&gt; . We can use basic_repr to quickly give us a more sensible default: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() __repr__ = basic_repr(&#39;a,b,c&#39;) Test(2) . Test(a=2, b=2, c=3) . . Monkey Patching With A Decorator . It can be convenient to monkey patch with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing. We can use the decorator @patch from fastcore.foundation along with type hints like so: . class MyClass(int): pass @patch def func(self:MyClass, a): return self+a mc = MyClass(3) . Now, MyClass has an additional method named func: . mc.func(10) . 13 . Still not convinced? I&#39;ll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section. . . A better pathlib.Path . When you see these extensions to pathlib.path you won&#39;t ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as: . Path.readlines: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.readlines() | Path.read: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.read() | Path.save: saves file as pickle | Path.load: loads pickle file | Path.ls: shows the contents of the path as a list. | etc. | . Read more about this here. Here is a demonstration of ls: . from pathlib import Path p = Path(&#39;../_notebooks&#39;) p.ls() # you don&#39;t get this with vanilla Pathlib.Path!! . (#21) [Path(&#39;../_notebooks/gpt2_simple_mask.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/bert_mac_small.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/causal_with_prefix.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/.DS_Store&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-03-07-How_to_Create_an_Automatic_Code_Comment_Generator_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-09-01-fastcore.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-03-07-Syntax-Highlighting.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-03-06-bart.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/README.md&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-05-01-TrainDonkeyCar.ipynb&#39;)...] . Wait! What&#39;s going on here? We just imported pathlib.Path - why are we getting this new functionality? Thats because we imported the fastcore.foundation module, which patches this module via the @patch decorator discussed earlier. Just to drive the point home on why the @patch decorator is useful, I&#39;ll go ahead and add another method to Path right now: . @patch def fun(self:Path): return &quot;This is fun!&quot; p.fun() . &#39;This is fun!&#39; . That is magical, right? I know! That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing about it! . . An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas . Self, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object. For example, let&#39;s create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array: . arr=np.array([5,4,3,2,1]) f = lambda a: a.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . You can use Self in the same way: . f = Self.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . Let&#39;s create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe: . import pandas as pd df=pd.DataFrame({&#39;Some Column&#39;: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, ], &#39;Another Column&#39;: [5, 7, 50, 70]}) f = Self.groupby(&#39;Some Column&#39;).mean() f(df) . Another Column . Some Column . a 6 | . b 60 | . Read more about Self in the docs). . . Notebook Functions . These are simple but handy, and allow you to know whether or not code is executing in a Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or an Ipython Shell: . in_notebook(), in_colab(), in_ipython() . (True, False, True) . This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment. . . A Drop-In Replacement For List . You might be pretty happy with Python&#39;s list. This is one of those situations that you don&#39;t know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you. Enter L, a list like object with many extra goodies. . The best way I can describe L is to pretend that list and numpy had a pretty baby: . define a list (check out the nice __repr__ that shows the length of the list!) . L(1,2,3) . (#3) [1,2,3] . Shuffle a list: . p = L.range(20).shuffle() p . (#20) [2,0,18,6,15,17,14,8,12,1...] . Index into a list: . p[2,4,6] . (#3) [18,15,14] . L has sensible defaults, for example appending an element to a list: . 1 + L(2,3,4) . (#4) [1,2,3,4] . There is much more L has to offer. Read the docs to learn more. . But Wait ... There&#39;s More! . There are more things I would like to show you about fastcore, but there is no way they would reasonably fit into a blog post. Here is a list of some of my favorite things that I didn&#39;t demo in this blog post: . Utilities . The Utilites section contain many shortcuts to perform common tasks or provide an additional interface to what standard python provides. . mk_class: quickly add a bunch of attributes to a class | wrap_class: add new methods to a class with a simple decorator | groupby: similar to Scala&#39;s groupby | merge: merge dicts | fasttuple: a tuple on steroids | Infinite Lists: useful for padding and testing | chunked: for batching and organizing stuff | . Multiprocessing . The Multiprocessing section extends python&#39;s multiprocessing library by offering features like: . progress bars | ability to pause to mitigate race conditions with external services | processing things in batches on each worker, ex: if you have a vectorized operation to perform in chunks | . Functional Programming . The functional programming section is my favorite part of this library. . maps: a map that also composes functions | mapped: A more robust map | using_attr: compose a function that operates on an attribute | . Transforms . Transforms is a collection of utilities for creating data transformations and associated pipelines. These transformation utilities build upon many of the building blocks discussed in this blog post. . Further Reading . It should be noted that you should read the main page of the docs first, followed by the section on tests to fully understand the documentation. . The fastcore documentation site. | The fastcore GitHub repo. | Blog post on delegation. | . Shameless plug: fastpages . This blog post was written entirely in a Jupyter Notebook, which GitHub automatically converted into to a blog post! Sound interesting? Check out fastpages. .",

            "content": "Paper Summary - Rapidly Deploying a Neural Search Engine for the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset . Overview of covidex.ai . This is a paper summary of deploying a Neural Search Engine to answer questions from the COVID-19 dataset. . Paper | covidex.ai | Twitter Announcement by Jimmy Lin | . Neural Covidex applies state-of-the-art neural network models and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to answer questions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) provided by the Allen Institute for AI (data release of April 3, 2020). This project is led by Jimmy Lin from the University of Waterloo and Kyunghyun Cho from NYU, with a small team of wonderful students: Edwin Zhang and Nikhil Gupta. Special thanks to Colin Raffel for his help in pretraining T5 models for the biomedical domain.” . . Motivation . The ongoing pandemic crisis poses a huge challenge to get timely information for public health officials, clinicians, researchers, virologists. In order to respond to this challenge, Allen AI publishes a COVID-19 data set (CORD-19) in collaboration with other research groups. The source for this data set is both research articles published about coronovirus and other related research articles. The aim of this effort is to bring researchers . to apply language processing techniques in order to generate insights &amp; make data driven decisions. | to provide ways for the front line to consume the recent developments in a digestible form &amp; apply in the field. | . Outcomes . Jimmy Lin &amp; his research team responded to this call. The two strategies adopted were . Real time users should be able to find answers to any questions associated with COVID | Other Researchers should be able reuse the components they build. Providing a modular and reusable components is set as part of the requirements. | . The team decided to build end to end real time search application called covidex.ai . They developed the components that powers this engine in a short span of time for the information retrieval need . . keyword based search interface : This also provides faceted navigation in the form of filters like author, article source, time range and highlighting words from the results that matches with user query. | neural ranking component that sorts the results with the top most results answering user’s question. | . Background &amp; Related Work . Traditional search architecture comprises of two phases Content Indexing and Keyword Searching. During indexing, content is transformed into an Indexable form called as Document The search engine convert this document into a fundamental data structure called as Inverted Index. This is similar to what you see in Book Appendix where terms are mapped towards the pages. Similarly Inverted index contains terms mapped towards docIds where the term appears &amp; position in the document. . Searching phase is further divided into two stages retrieval stage and ranking stage. In the first stage, given a search term(s) you will retrieve the list of matching documents from the inverted index. In the second stage, the matched documents are sorted based on the computed relevance score. . Modern Search Architectures . More modern multi-stage search architectures from Bing &amp; Alibaba expand the Search Phase with additional reranking stages. Except for the first retrieval stage, the additional subsequent ranking stages will rerank and refine the results further from previous stages . . Modular and Reusable Keyword Search . Anserini . Anserini is an opensource Information Retrieval toolkit in order to solve the reproducibility problems in research and bridge the gap between research and real world systems. This is a tool that is built on top of Lucene, a popular open source search library &amp; enhanced with features specific for conducting IR research. pyserini is a python interface to Anserini. . Indexing . The first challenge faced by the team is representing the Indexable Document. This is fundamental unit of search engine. Results are basically collection of documents. Eg: Tweets, WebPage, Article . One of the common challenge wrt Information Retrieval systems, they tend to favor longer documents. In order to give all documents a fairer chances irrespective of its length, normalization is needed. . The articles are in the following format . { title : “Impact of Masks”, abstract: “Masks protects others from you.” body_text : “Effectiveness of mask /n /n This is being studied …..” } . In order to compare the effectiveness, the team decide to index the articles in 3 different ways . Index only the title and abstract of the article as a document | Index the entire text of the article as a document combining title, abstract and body_text | Break the body_text of the article into paragraphs and each paragraph as separate documents. In this case, the Indexable Document is title, abstract &amp; the paragraph. | . Searching . Once the team built the lucene indices based on the above scheme for CORD-19, we can able to search for a given term, retrieve matching documents and ranked them using BM25 scoring function. These indices are available for the researchers to perform further research. . The full search pipeline for keyword search is demonstrated using notebooks using Pyserini. . In order to provide the users a live system that can be used to answer questions, the team leveraged their earlier work on anserini integration with Solr , open source search platform. The user search interface is built using Blacklight discovery interface with Ruby on Rails for faceting &amp; highlighting. . . Highlighting . In addition to that the team also built a highlighting feature on of keyword search. This allows the user to quickly scan the results with the matched keywords in the document. . It is built using BioBERT. The idea behind it is that a) the candidate matched documents &amp; convert them into sentences. b) Similarly the query is treated as a sentence. The sentences &amp; query are in turn converted into its numerical representations (vectors). Top sentences closer to the query are obtained using the cosine similarity. The top-K words in the context are highlighted in these top sentences. . Neural Covidex for reranking . The research group was already working on the neural architectures specifically applying transfer learning on retrieval/ranking based problems. . BERT for query based Passage Ranking : Applying transfer learning for passage reranking pre-trained on MS-MARCO dataset | BERTserini for retrieval-based question answering: Incorporating Anserini Retriever to retrieve the top K segments of text followed by BERT based pre-trained model to retrieve the answer span. | . Typically the task of reranking is turn the problem into a classification task where we take the query, candidate_document &amp; predict the target as (relevant, not-relevant). To avoid the costly operation of performing classification on the entire corpus, this is applied at the reranking stages. The engine gets the top K documents from the previous retrieval stage and rerank them using machine learning model. As part of reranking stage, the team leveraged Sequence to Sequence Model for reranking (Nogueira et al. 2020). . Stages involved in training the reranking model using Transfer Learning Methodology . Pre-training →Fine Tuning → Inference . [Pre-training] Transformer based Language Model trained on MS Marco dataset | [Fine Tuning] Given a query q, document D, the model is fine tuned to predict the output as either true or false as targets indicating the relevance. | [Inference] In reranking setting, for each candidate documents, predict the prob distribution of (relevant, non-relevant) and sort the scores of relevant doc(true outputs) alone. | . Training a language model and the encoder from this fined tuned language model is normally used for the downstream tasks like Classification in transfer learning methodology. But this method of applying Sequence to Sequence model (based on T5) is quite new for document ranking setting (Nogueira et al., 2020). . The reasoning provided was the predicted target words can capture the relatedness through pre-training. This is based on encoder-decoder architecture &amp; uses a similar masked language modeling objective. Given a query, document the model is fine tuned to produce true or false if the document is relevant or not to the query. . Challenges in Results Evaluation . The authors rightfully mention that the individual components comprising such a system is evaluated against various test datasets. But as this is specific to an evolving dataset like CORD-19, there is no such existing test collections. . | It is not always necessary that ranking is the most important for such an end to end system. We have to switch to an outcome based measure rather than a single output based measure like batch retrieval evaluations(MRR, nDCG). Eg: “Did the researchers, practitioners get their questions answered?” How many of them are not finding the answers? So involving human in the loop to qualitatively evaluate the results is essential to know if the system is really contributing towards the efforts fighting the pandemic. . | What if the exploratory users do not know the right type of keywords to use ? In that case ranking is a wrong goal to pursue. . | Current challenge is all the targeted users are working on the front line and hard to provide qualitative feedback about search experience. So the author asks for more hallway usability testing to gather insights from the users. . | . Author Reflections . An end to end system like Covidex is not possible without the power of the current Open Source Software ecosystem, Open culture of curating, cleaning &amp; sharing the data with the community (Thanks to CORD-19 by Allen AI) and pre-trained language models like MS-Marco etc. . Good software engineering practices is the foundation for a team and ensure that the underlying software components can be replicated &amp; reused to provide this system. This is essential to rapidly explore and experiment with new ideas. . Building a strong research culture to produce the results in the form of open source software artifacts aid the community in reproducing the results and build on top of it. . Reminder about the mismatch between producing research code for conference and building a system for a real users. For example concerns like latency of search requests, throughput about the number of users, deploying &amp; managing a system in production, user experience does not arise in a research setting. . Insights &amp; Takeaways from this paper . Lack of proper training data &amp; human annotators is a common challenge. Leveraging pre-trained models on MS-MARCO is critical for ranking tasks in this type of situation. | The experimentation mindset need to be adopted and one need to interactive computing tools like pyserini to experiment with search index. This allows the search practitioners to constantly iterate and learn from these experiments. | Adoption of Openness in not only the source but science and data &amp; the way we work is truly inspiring. | .",
